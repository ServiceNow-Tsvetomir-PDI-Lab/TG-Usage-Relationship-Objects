## Overview

**TG Usage Relationship Objects** is a toolkit of two ServiceNow developer tools:

- **Script Include and Function Usage**: Track where Script Includes and their methods are used
- **Usage Field**: Detect field references across scripts using `sys_dictionary` field `sys_id`

These tools help:
- Perform fast impact analysis
- Improve script maintenance and documentation
- Validate refactor safety
- Streamline debugging across your ServiceNow instance
